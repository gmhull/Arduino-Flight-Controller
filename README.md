# Arduino-Flight-Controller
Custom flight controller using Arduino Uno.

This project was based on Joop Brokking's auto-leveling quadcopter build.  To set
up the drone, first run the YMFC-AL_setup to save settings on the Arduino with
eeprom.  YMFC-AL_esc_calibrate can be used to test out the quadcopter before
flying.  YMFC-AL_Flight_controller holds the flight controller code for the build.

A wiring diagram is on its way.
