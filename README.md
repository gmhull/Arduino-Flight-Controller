# Arduino Flight Controller
This arduino flight controller project was inspired by Joop Brokking's auto-leveling quadcopter build.  My goal was to build this drone from scratch and then use an arduino as a controller instead of using an existing flight controller board.  The body of the drone was designed and 3D printed by me, I custom built a circuit board to connect all electronics, and I built out this flight controller to get everything working together.  

## Custom Software Library ##
In order to speed up the barometer call and response time, I forked the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BMP280_Library">Adafruit BMP280</a> library.  You can check out my modified version of the library <a href="https://github.com/gmhull/Adafruit_BMP280_Library_Modified">here</a>.

# Iterations
## Version 1 ##
The project has gone through a few iterations.  Version 1 was made using an Arduino Uno board at the core.  This was a quick build designed to get something into the air for the first time.  The body was a rough design and had a lot of flaws that made it harder to work with.  These were dealt with in the next iteration of the drone.

## Version 2 ##
The main upgrade for version 2 was a redesign of the drone body.  My friend got a DJI mini drone with foldable arms for storage and I wanted to try the same thing with this project.  I replaced the fixed arms with arms that all swiveled into the body.  Secondly, I created a complete bottom half of the drone so that the battery was no longer exposed.  There were a handful of small electronics adjustments as well.  In order to save space on the inside, I swapped out the Arduino Uno for an Arduino Nano to save space.  I also added a power switch onto the outside of the drone to make turning the motors on and off easier and safer.  Finally, I added a magnetic cover to the drone so that I could easily remove the top case to access electronics.

## Version 3 ##
I am currently working on a 3rd version of the drone.  This time, I am going back to a fixed arm setup after having stability issues.  The flight controller will still be Arduino based, but I designed a custom circuit board using EagleCAD to produce a slim design.  Tune in for future updates.

You can find the STL files to print your own drone body <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/526128-drone-v2">here</a> on Printables.

# Setup
Once you have a built drone, you need to start by running the Drone_Setup file.  This will run you through a series of prompts to make sure that everything is set up correctly and that the correct remote inputs are being used.  At the end of these prompts, all data will be saved to the EEPROM.  
Next, run Drone_ESC_Calibrate in order to test out the accelerometer and motors.  This will let you make sure that the motors are spinning the correct directions and that the drone is reading the correct orientation.
Once this is done you can run Drone_Flight_Controller.  Before you fly you should start by tuning the PID values at the top of the program; this will give you optimal performance.  

# PID Tuning
This is the process that I used to tune the PID controller for auto leveling the drone.  There may be better ways, but this worked for me.

Be careful when performing these steps.  Use appropriate safety gear. 
1. Set P gain to 1 and I/D to 0.  Check to make sure that the drone moves in the correct directions when the sticks are moved.
2. D Gain:
    * Increase the D gain in increments of 1 until the drone starts getting restless in the air.
    * Lower until the drone flies steady.
    * Take off 25% to get the final value.
3. P Gain:
    * Increase the P gain in increments of 0.2 until the drone starts oscillating slowly.
    * Decrease by 50% to get the final value.
4. I Gain:
    * Increase the I gain in increments of 0.01 until the drone starts overcompensating.
    * Decrease by 50% to get the final value.
5. P Gain Again: 
    * Increase the P gain until it starts oscillating.
    * Take off a few points.
6. Optimize the values with trial and error.

This was a slow process to get values that worked well for me.
