# Arduino-Flight-Controller
Custom flight controller using Arduino Uno.

This project was based on Joop Brokking's auto-leveling quadcopter build.  To set
up the drone, first run the Drone_Setup file to save settings on the Arduino with
eeprom.  Drone_ESC_Calibrate can be used to test out the quadcopter before
flying.  Drone_Flight_Controller holds the flight controller code for the build.

A wiring diagram is on its way.
